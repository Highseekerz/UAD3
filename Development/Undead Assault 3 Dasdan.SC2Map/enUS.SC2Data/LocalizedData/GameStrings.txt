Param/Value/263B0C19=<n/><c val="00BF60">Welcome to Undead Assault 3: Dasdan! (UAD for short)<n/><n/>UAD is a successor to UA3, and in some cases, UAC.<n/>Many of the mechanics you know from past undead assault games have changed in some fashion, so make sure to read all tooltips with the expectation that things DO NOT do what they used to do. I'll put a few here for you so you get a little taste of what differences this game has to offer:<n/><n/>-Map is totally different. Not only is the layout new, but it was even done from a straight-up blank map - as compared to the typical restructuring of the Thalim AO.<n/>-Medics are no longer the only character who can revive. Every character who dies now has a 30 second revive timer, other characters can revive dead characters by targeting the dead character's dead hero indicator with the revive ability and channeling it. Medic reduces the timer by 5 every 1 second, other characters reduce it by 1 every 1 second.<n/>-Every MOS does or will have a different skillset than what they previously had. Some may be very similar, others very different, but they're all different, at least a little bit.<n/>-The jam mechanic has been completely removed<n/>-Armor items behavior significantly different (I'll let you guys play around with this one a little ;) )<n/>-... And countless other things<n/><n/>Now, here are a few more technical things that you'll want to know to succeed:<n/>"Counters" have been simplified to a predictable system. There are 3 main types of targets you're going to want to pay attention to when determining counters, these are: light units, heavy units, and units with "armor" (what we call "armor" in this game is what you likely know as protoss shields, note that standard SC2 armor will not be a part of this game, so don't confuse it with that). There are many different damage types and all scale differently based on what type of target you are attacking. I will summarize them here:<n/><n/>-Bullet: 100% vs light, 100% vs heavy, 25% vs armor<n/>-Explosive - Fragmentation: 150% vs light, 100% vs heavy, 50% vs armor<n/>-Explosive - Anti-Tank: 100% vs light, 150% vs heavy, 50% vs armor<n/>-Fire: 200% vs light, 100% vs heavy, 10% vs armor<n/>-Acid: 100% vs everything<n/>-Plasma: 100% vs everything<n/><n/>These damage types only do different amounts of damage vs targets with armor:<n/>-Slashing: 25% vs armor<n/>-Blunt: 35% vs armor<n/>-Piercing: 80% vs armor<n/><n/>Skills should ALWAYS say their damage type in bright yellow at the bottom of their tooltip, and zombies will say it in their weapon tooltip. All basic attacks from heroes currently deal bullet damage.<n/><n/>The ailment system also got a huge revamp, now there is a wide variety of ailments and they are categorized such that only certain items/abilities can cure certain ailments. Now the tooltips on relevant skills SHOULD suffice for this area, but I figure people are gonna get confused anyways so lets just talk about this as a safeguard:<n/>-If the ailment is minor: any basic skill/item that cures that ailment's type can cure it.<n/>-If the ailment is moderate: only advanced items and level 2 skills that cures that ailment's type can cure it.<n/>-If the ailment is severe: only a level 2 skill with its emergency protocols skill upgrade can cure it. Luckily, severe ailments are only obtained by letting a moderate ailment sit too long, so with diligence you won't have to deal with this.<n/>-If the ailment type is lacerations or bone damage: first aid kit style skills can cure it if they are the proper level.<n/>-If the ailment type is hemorrhage or infection: injection/clot style skills can cure it if they are the proper level.<n/>-If the ailment type is poison: anti-venin style skills can cure it if they are the proper level.
