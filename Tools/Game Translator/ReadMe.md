SC2_GameTranslater
=====================
Hi SC2 modders, I'm Whimsyduke form Team Froggy&Catty. SC2_GameTranslater is one of our open source projects for Starcraft II mod community. With this tool, Modders can translate your Map/Mod in to different local languages, we wish this tool can help you sharing your works and increasing communications between people all around the world. 

Based on our translate experience, we have developed utiilty kits such as auto backup, modification and text search/comparison to simplify and optimize the translation process. This tool also supports various functions such as collation, content filtration and in game preview. The translater can even finish the translation without complete mod or map files. So this tool can also be good partner of players and project cooperators.
